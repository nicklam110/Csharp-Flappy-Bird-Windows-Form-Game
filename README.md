# Flappy Bird Windows Form

This game was created as my Final Project for my C# class at Kean University (CPS 4981*02: .NET FRAMEWORK & C#) instructed by Dr. Yullia Kumar. 

I used Visual Studio 2022 as my IDE for this project and was inspired by https://www.mooict.com/create-flappy-bird-game-in-visual-studio-using-c/ .

As I was inspired by that link, I added a few personal modifications myself to the game:
  - Created a dificulty increaser using if statements as the score increments, the game becomes faster and harder
  - Made a new function called "startGame()" this resets all values to their default positions
  - Using my newly created "startGame()" function I added a feature that whenever the user presses the "R" key during the "endGame()" method, the "startGame()" is then       called and the game resets.

### Game Tip!!
- Do not spam the space bar. 
- Simply hold the spacebar to move the bird upwards and release it to allow gravity to pull the bird downwards. 

### Where to find the code:
The Code for this game can be found in the "Form1.cs" file.


Thank you and I hope you enjoy! :)
